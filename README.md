### Hi there 👋

Welcome to my github! Theres a not a ton on here. Most of my contributions have been internal to my job at Clutter, however I am trying to build more software recreationionally.

Most of my experience is with Ruby (Rails) and JS (React, Angular). I am OK with Python and SQL.

- 🔭 I’m currently trying to [blog](https://df.dev/blog) more and spruce up my website with more projects. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about web3
- 💬 Ask me about anything! I'd love to help!
- 📫 How to reach me: davidafeinerman@gmail.com
- 🕺🏻 Fun fact: Offline I love to go disc golfing and read Sci Fi
